    """ This abstract base class defines the variables and methods that every periodic-frequent pattern mining algorithm must
        employ in PAMI

       Attributes
        ----------
        iFile : str
            Input file name or path of the input file
        minSup: int or float or str
            The user can specify minSup either in count or proportion of database size.
            If the program detects the data type of minSup is integer, then it treats minSup is expressed in count.
            Otherwise, it will be treated as float.
            Example: minSup=10 will be treated as integer, while minSup=10.0 will be treated as float
        maxPer: int or float or str
            The user can specify maxPer either in count or proportion of database size.
            If the program detects the data type of maxPer is integer, then it treats maxPer is expressed in count.
            Otherwise, it will be treated as float.
            Example: maxPer=10 will be treated as integer, while maxPer=10.0 will be treated as float
        sep : str
            This variable is used to distinguish items from one another in a transaction. The default seperator is tab space or \t.
            However, the users can override their default separator.
        startTime:float
            To record the start time of the algorithm
        endTime:float
            To record the completion time of the algorithm
        finalPatterns: dict
            Storing the complete set of patterns in a dictionary variable
        oFile : str
            Name of the output file to store complete set of periodic-frequent patterns
        memoryUSS : float
            To store the total amount of USS memory consumed by the program
        memoryRSS : float
            To store the total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program

        Methods
        -------
        startMine()
            Mining process will start from here
        getPatterns()
            Complete set of patterns will be retrieved with this function
        savePatterns(oFile)
            Complete set of periodic-frequent patterns will be loaded in to a output file
        getPatternsAsDataFrame()
            Complete set of periodic-frequent patterns will be loaded in to data frame
        getMemoryUSS()
            Total amount of USS memory consumed by the program will be retrieved from this function
        getMemoryRSS()
            Total amount of RSS memory consumed by the program will be retrieved from this function
        getRuntime()
            Total amount of runtime taken by the program will be retrieved from this function

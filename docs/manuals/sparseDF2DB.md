## Converting a sparse dataframe into different database formats
Currently, PAMI supports converting a dataframe into a transactional database, temporal database, ond a utility database.
The users can avail this support by employing the methods available in **dataPreprocessign.SparseFormatDF** class.  
We now present these three methods.

### Sparse dataframe into a transactional database
#### Description
A [transactional database](transactionalDatabase.html) represents a sparse and binary representation of items occurring in a dataframe. 
The steps to convert a dataframe into a transactional database is as follows:

1. Initialize the SparseFormatDF class by passing the following three parameters: 
   1. inputDataFrame  - the dataframe that needs to converted into a database
   1. thresholdValue  - this value will be used to convert a non-binary data frame into a binary database
   1. condition       - The condition that needs to employed on the threshold value. Currently, the users can specify 
      the following six constraints: >, >=, <, <=, ==, and !=.

1. Call 'createTransactional(outputFileName)' method to store the dataframe as a transactional database.

#### Sample code

 ```Python
from PAMI.extras.DF2DB import SparseFormatDF as pro
import pandas as pd

# Objective: convert the above dataframe into a transactional database with items whose value is greater than or equal 1.
db = pro.SparseFormatDF(inputDF=pd.read_csv('mentionDataFrame'), thresholdValue=1, condition='>=')
# Convert and store the dataframe as a transactional database file
db.createTransactionalDatabase(outputFile='/home/userName/transactionalDB.txt')
# Getting the fileName of the transactional database
print('The output file is saved at ' + db.getFileName())


   ```

### Sparse dataframe into a temporal database
#### Description
A [temporal database](temporalDatabase.html) represents a sparse and binary representation of items occurring at a particular timestamp
in a dataframe.  The steps to convert a dataframe into a temporal database is as follows:

1. Initialize the SparseFormatDF class by passing the following three parameters: 
   1. inputDataFrame  - the dataframe that needs to converted into a database
   1. thresholdValue  - this value will be used to convert a non-binary data frame into a binary database
   1. condition       - The condition that needs to employed on the threshold value. Currently, the users can specify 
      the following six constraints: >, >=, <, <=, ==, and !=.

1. Call 'createTemporal(outputFileName)' method to store the dataframe as a temporal database.

#### Sample code

 ```Python
from PAMI.extras.DF2DB import SparseFormatDF as pro
from PAMI.periodicFrequentPattern.basic import PFPGrowthPlus as alg
import pandas as pd

# Objective: convert the above dataframe into a transactional database with items whose value is greater than or equal 1.
db = pro.SparseFormatDF(inputDataFrame=pd.read_csv('mentionDataFrame'), thresholdValue=1, condition='>=')
# Convert and store the dataframe as a temporal database file
db.createTemporalDatabase(outputFile='/home/userName/temporalDB.txt')
# Getting the fileName of the temporal database
print('The output file is saved at ' + db.getFileName())

### Sparse dataframe into a utility database
#### Description
A[utility
database](utilityDatabase.html)
represents
a
sparse and non - binary
representation
of
items
occurring in
each
row
of
a
dataframe.The
steps
to
convert
a
dataframe
into
a
utility
database is as follows:

1.
Initialize
the
SparseFormatDF


class by passing the following three parameters:
    1.
    inputDataFrame - the
    dataframe
    that
    needs
    to
    converted
    into
    a
    database
    1.
    thresholdValue - this
    value
    will
    be
    used
    to
    convert
    a
    non - binary
    data
    frame
    into
    a
    binary
    database
    1.
    condition - The
    condition
    that
    needs
    to
    employed
    on
    the
    threshold
    value.Currently, the
    users
    can
    specify
    the
    following
    six
    constraints: >, >=, <, <=, ==, and !=.

    1.
    Call
    'createUtility(outputFileName)'
    method
    to
    store
    the
    dataframe as a
    temporal
    database.

    #### Sample code

    ```Python
    from PAMI.extras.DF2DB import SparseFormatDF as pro
    from PAMI.highUtilityPattern.basic import EFIM as alg
    import pandas as pd

    # Objective: convert the above dataframe into a utility database with items whose value is greater than or equal 1.
    db = pro.SparseFormatDF(inputDataFrame=pd.read_csv('mentionDataFrame'), thresholdValue=1, condition='>=')
    # Convert and store the dataframe as a utility database file
    db.createUtilityDatabase(outputFile='/home/userName/utilityDB.txt')
    # Getting the fileName of the utility database
    print('The output file is saved at ' + db.getFileName())

  ```

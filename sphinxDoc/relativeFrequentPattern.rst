Relative Frequency is an extension of frequency where each frequency is represented relative to all the present frequencies of different quantities.
Frequency in mathematics represents the actual occurrence of quantities whereas relative frequency represents the occurrence of quantities relative to each other.
Suppose if we have a term with frequency f and the total frequency of all the observation is n, then the relative frequency of the given observation is f/n.
